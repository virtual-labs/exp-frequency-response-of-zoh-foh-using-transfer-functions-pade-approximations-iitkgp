### About the Experiment 

 **The Hold Operation**

In the computer-controlled systems, it is necessary to convert the control actions calculated by the computer as a sequence of numbers, to a continuous-time signal that can be applied to the process.<br/><br>
            
The problem of hold operation may be posed as follows:<br>
Given a sequence 

$$ {y(0), y(1),..., y(k),...} $$ 

We have to construct

$$ y_a(t), t \ge 0 $$

A commonly used solution to the problem of hold operation is polynomial extrapolation. Using Taylorâ€™s series expansion about <img src="experiment/images/t_kT.png">, we can express 
$$ y_a(t) = y_a(kT) + \dot y_a (kT)(t-kT)+ \frac {\ddot y_a(kT)}{2!} (t-kT)^2 +...; kT \le t \lt (k+1)T \tag{1} $$
where,
$$ \dot y_a (kT) \cong \frac{1}{T} [y_a(kT)-y_a((k-1)T)] $$ 
$$ \ddot y_a(kT) \cong \frac{1}{T^2} [y_a(kT)-2y_a((k-1)T)+y_a((k-2)T)] $$


If only the first term in expansion (1) is used, the data hold is called a zero-order hold (ZOH). 
Here we assume that the function  <img src="experiment/images/ya_t.png"> is approximately constant within the sampling interval, at a value equal to that of the function at the preceding sampling instant. 
Therefore, for a given input sequence <img src="experiment/images/yk.png">, the output of ZOH is given by <br>
$$ y_a(t) = y(k) ; kT \le t \lt (k+1)T \tag{2} $$

The first two terms in expansion (1) are used to realize the first-order hold. For a given input sequence <img src="experiment/images/yk.png">, the output of the first-order hold is given by<br>
$$ y_a(t) = y(k) + \frac {t-kT}{T} [y(k) - y(k-1)] \tag{3} $$

It is obvious from expansion (1) that the higher the order of the derivative to be approximated, the larger will be the number of delay pulses required. The time-delay adversely affects the stability of feedback control systems. 
Furthermore, a high-order extrapolation requires complex circuitry and results in high costs of construction. The ZOH is the simplest, and most commonly used, data hold device. 
The standard D/A converters are often designed in such a way that the old value is held constant until a new conversion is ordered.
